<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Ankit Purakayastha. I am currently pursuing a B.Tech in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning under IT department at MCKV Institute of Engineering.</p>

<p> Throughout my academic journey, I have developed a strong foundation in various aspects of AI and ML, including data analysis, machine learning algorithms, and neural networks.One of the key projects I worked on involved developing a predictive model for image recognittion of humans and other objects using machine learning techniques like YOLO,RCNN,BMask,GMask. This project not only honed my technical skills but also taught me the importance of data accuracy and ethical considerations in AI.</p>

<p>My goal is to leverage my skills and knowledge to contribute to innovative AI solutions that can solve real-world problems. I am excited about the opportunity to bring my enthusiasm and expertise to new challenges and continue growing in this dynamic field.</p>
